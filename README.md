Homework Assignment 4: Designing a Hypermedia Type: Paleo Recipe Book

----------
This information (web) service handles Paleo Recipes that are, by definition “Paleo”, as its primary resources. These recipes do not contain grains, dairy, processed sugar/preservatives, corn or corn byproducts, legumes, or white/starchy potatoes, and only contain fruits, vegetables, meats, and natural sugars. 

Each recipe can be divided into data units made up of the following sections: Recipe Title, Ingredients, Prep Instruction, Cooking Instruction, and Comments. These are the components that the service will require information about for each resource.

The primary resources (recipes) can be classified by their Category, Type, and Title, which are also defined as resources.

The following labels define examples of items that would be instances of each resource: 

- Category: “Entre”, “Beverage”, “Soup or Stew, “Desert”, etc.;
- Type is defined as the name of the main ingredient of the recipe;
- Title is the given name of the recipe.
